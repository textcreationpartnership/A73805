            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the loue of God hath heerein exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded vnto vs, that we are called the Sons of God;
<pb facs="tcp:131953:3"/> ſo there is not a more pregnant Embleme of our Adoption to be his Children, then that wee cry Abba, Father; nor a more liuely pledge of our loue vnto God, then that we doe caſt our ſelues into the armes of his mercy, by faithfull prayer. Oh how much better is it to bee a doore-keeper in the Houſe of God, then to ſit on the Throne with Princes? How exceeding were the riches of Gods mercie towards vs, that ſpared not his onely Sonne vnto death, to reſtore vs from death, to life? That the Lord of Glory became a Seruant vnto all, that hee might redeeme vs from the bondage of ſinne, into tbe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the Sonnes of God? That life it ſelfe became death, that hee might deliuer vs from death vnto life: That
<pb facs="tcp:131953:3"/> he that knew no ſinne, but was perfect holineſſe it ſelfe, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſinne for our ſakes, that we might be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God in him. Surely, if <hi>Dauid</hi> thought it an high aduancement to bee the ſonne in law to an earthly &amp; wicked King, How much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is our aduancement, that we are become the adopted ſons of the Almighty, and Holyeſt God, who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords? And if the Queene of Saba counted the ſeruants of <hi>Salomon</hi> happie, becauſe they enioyed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and were partakers of the worldly and fading Comforts as abounded in his Court: Oh how much more happie is the condition of the Saints of God that do not only enioy the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence of God with open
<pb facs="tcp:131953:4"/> face, in whoſe fauour is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, but are thereby tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the ſame image, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glory to glory, as by the Spirit of GOD, that ſo they may bee made meete partakers of that glorious inheritance with the Saints in light; euen that light which is immortall and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, which fadeth not? If to be rich in faith &amp; good workes be the true and dureable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which fayleth not; If the ioy of the Spirit be that which none can take away from vs; If all earthly honor be as dung in compariſon of that inward glory wherewith the Kinges daughter is adorned; If theyr ſafety be impregnable, which haue a wall of fire to beguirt them, &amp; therein walking most ſecure that haue the Lord of Hoſts to protect &amp; guide them;
<pb facs="tcp:131953:4"/> then happy ſurely, and thrice happy is the condition of Gods Children, who haue God to bee their Portion, and may enioy durable riches, pure and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Comfort, honor that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fadeth, and ſecurity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſecuritie. For as our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in God makes vs watchful ouer our owne waies, and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of our owne inability, ſo heereby are we daily cast vpon the riches of Chriſt, and from him encreaſe and grow in grace. And as we grow in grace ſo do we attaine to, and proſper more and more in peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and thereby abound with ioy in the holy Ghoſt. And the more we are filled with ioy and peace in beleeuing, the more do we glorify our God in cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience, and ſo as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are more intirely intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:131953:5"/> in the glorie of our head, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching heereby neerer to the life of Glory, the more wee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer all our oppoſitions, and are more throughly abaſed and excluded of all glorying in our ſelues, that ſo dooing all things to the glory of our God, we may be aduanced by him in abaſing our ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what can now hinder vs heerefrom, whereto all things ſhall further? No trouble can do it, ſeeing it prepares thereto: No, not ſinne ſhall hinder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not imputed; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auailes to the imputation of righteouſneſſe, that ſo the ſting of ſinne may be remoued. It is not life can doe it, becauſe we are dead vnto ſinne; neither
<pb facs="tcp:131953:5"/> ſhall death auaile hereunto, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are aliue vnto GOD. Much leſſe may Angels hinder, becauſe they are miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for our good, to keepe vs in all our waies: Nor Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can preuaile, becauſe the Kingdomes are the Lords, and ſo ouerſeers to the Saints: It is not powers ſhall hinder, ſeeing all power is giuen to our Head; and ſo in him we are able to doe all things: Neither things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhould ought auaile hereto, becauſe we liue by Faith, &amp; not by ſight, and ſo can lay vp a good Foundation by them ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And how ſhal height hinder vs who haue the Higheſt to bee our hope, whom lowlineſſe aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and highneſſe abaſeth?

No, no, it is not hell can hinder vs ſeeing it is deſtroyed, nor Satan ſhall preuaile, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue the ſhield of Faith to reſiſt him, hee will flye from vs</p>
            <p>Behold the wonderfull and glorious priuiledges of the ſons of God! And by this wee know, that we haue this glorious vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellowſhip with God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his Spirit that hee hath giuen vs. And hereby we know effectually, that the Spirit

Thus by the Spirit, wee know our Adoption, and by the Spirit of Prayer, we pleade the ſame. And can we be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Spirite helpes our Infirmities, and knovves our Wants? Shall wee not preuaile aboue whatſoeuer wee can aske or thinke, ſeeing our Sauiour is our Aduocate to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for vs, who knowes what is beſt for vs, who heares before we aske, and askes that we may be heard?</p>
            <p>Behold here the ground and neceſsitie of Prayer. If the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be in vs, we ſhall pray in the Spirit; and if we pray in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie

            <p>Que. <hi>What beleeueſt thou in the ſecond part concerning God the Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt one God in ſubſtance with the Father and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, tooke fleſh of the Virgin, and is become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man as I am in al things ſinne onely excepted, and in my Nature hath wrought for mee, whatſoeuer was needfull for my ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What meaneſt thou, when thou ſayeſt, Hee ſuffered
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:131953:25"/> vnder Pontius Pilate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. Becauſe that manner of death which men do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by the ſentence of the Iudge, and vnder the Title of Iuſtice, is more ſhameful, ſlanderous and terrible, then if a man ſhould dye natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his bedde. Therefore Chriſt took on him our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to ſhew himſelfe before an earthly Iudge, and to bee condemned by the mouth of <hi>Pilate,</hi> hee being then Iudge, that therby we might be cleared before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of God.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What meaneſt thou, when thou ſayeſt, Chriſt was crucified, dead, and buried.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Firſt I meane, in that he was crucified, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the death of the croſſe, which was an abhominable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:131953:26"/> and curſed death, to deliuer mee from the curſe vvhich was due for my ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, foraſmuch as death was a puniſhment due vnto man for ſinne, therfore our Sauiour did ſuffer death and by ſuffering, ouercame death. For in his death doth lye the principall point of our ſaluation: for, if he had not beene truely dead, wee ſhould be yet ſubiect to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death and damnation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he was buried, for the more greater confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And in the intent to make it more certainely knowne vnto vs, it pleaſed him alſo to bee buried after the common maner of men, and that by two notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:131953:26"/> of <hi>Aramathia,</hi> which was done alſo by the wil &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who cauſed the body to be deliuered to them.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What meanest thou concerning this, that Chriſt deſcended into hell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Where it is ſaid, that Chriſt deſcended into Hell, therby I beleeue, that Chriſt did not onely ſuffer in his body the puniſhment due to my body; but alſo in his ſoul the puniſhment due to my ſoule, which was, the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, ſecond death, ſorrowes of death, and abie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God, as it doeth appeare by the anguiſh of his ſoule in the garden, when drops of blood yſſued out of his body, and alſo vppon the Croſſe by his lamentable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:131953:27"/> crie to his Father. For in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable caſe had we beene, if he had ſuffered onely the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to our bodies, and not to our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What fruite haſt thou by the death of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt I beleeue, that this death and puniſhment, which Chriſt ſuffered, is the appeaſing of Gods wrath, &amp; a full ſatisfaction to God for all my ſinnes. Secondly, that as he is dead for ſinne, ſo he will cauſe ſinne to die in my mortall body.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What profit haſt thou by the riſing againe of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Firſt, I am aſſured by his riſing from death, that he hath ouercome death, hel and ſinne, and hath finiſhed my iuſtification. Secondly, that as he is riſen from death
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:131953:27"/> ſo he cauſeth mee as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of him, to riſe from ſin, and delight in righteouſnes. Thirdly, his riſing againe, is a ſure pledge to me, that my body ſhal in like manner riſe againe.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What is the meaning of this, that Chriſt aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Chriſt as touching his manhead, is onely in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but in his Godhead and comfort of his holy Spirite, hee is with vs to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What good getteſt thou by the aſcending of Chriſt into heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Firſt, Chriſt his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into heauen, is a ſure pledge vnto mee, that I ſhal in like maner as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of him, by his power, be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:131953:28"/> receyued into heauen, in that ſame nature wherein he is aſcended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt hauing aſcended into Heauen, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth continuall interceſſion for me.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What is the meaning of this, that Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of the father, that is, hath all power giuen him of the Father ouer all things whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What fruite doſt thou receiue by this, that Chriſt ſhal come to iudge the quicke, and the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To mee that am a member of Chriſt, it is a ſingular comfort, vvhen I know aſſuredly, that none
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:131953:28"/> ſhal be my Iudge but he that is my Sauiour. But terrible it will be to thoſe that flee from Chriſt, when they ſhall ſee him come to iudg them, whom they in their life time refuſed.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What beleeueſt thou in the third part, concerning God the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> I beleeue that GOD the holy Ghoſt, ſealeth into my heart all Chriſtes bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites to be mine, and maketh ſinne to dye in me, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me vp to righteouſnes, and holineſſe of life.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>Seeing there is but one onely God, why nameſt thou the Father, the Sonne, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An. Becauſe God hath ſo opened himſelfe in his Word, that theſe three ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:131953:29"/> perſons are in ſubſtance but one true and euerlaſting God.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>Now let vs come to the fourth part: What calleſt thou the Catholicke Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Catholicke Church, is the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of faithful people, that euer were ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which alſo be now, and ſhall bee to the end of the world. Of the which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I beleeue that I am one: I beleeue that God knoweth them all, and hath a moſt tender care ouer them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. What calleſt thou the Communion of Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> The Communion of Saints, is the ſociety that all we which beleeue haue one with another, as members
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:131953:29"/> of one head Ieſus Chriſt: whereby wee are ready to communicate all Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, both Spirituall and Temporall, to the mutuall health and comfort one of another, according vnto the meaſure which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of God in this life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. What is it to beleeue the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> I beleeue, that Ieſus Chriſt hath wholy appeaſed God for my ſinnes, &amp; paide the full puniſhment due to them, and therfore that they be freely forgiuen mee, and ſhall neuer be laide vnto my charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. What beleeueſt thou of the riſing againe of the body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I beleeue, that after this life e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nded, my ſoule ſhal go to God that gaue it, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:131953:30"/> my body ſhall reſt in the graue vntill the appoynted time: and then, I ſhall ſee God in my fleſh, and mine eyes ſhall looke vpon him: and this my bodie, ſhall bee made like to the glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, without al cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. What is it that thou ſayeſt of Life euerlaſting?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> I beleeue, that when God ſhall raiſe againe this my body, and ioyn it againe together with my ſoule, that then I ſhall liue with Chriſt for euer, in his euerlaſting kingdome of glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. By what means do we attaine to this, which thou haſt heere confeſſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> The holy Ghoſt hath appointed the preaching of the word to be the ordinary
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:131953:30"/> meanes, whereby hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in our hearts this true and liuely faith, and without this preaching of the Word we can neuer haue faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. After that GOD by the meanes of his word, hath wrought in our hearts faith, by what meanes afterward doeth he ſtrengthen the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> This faith doth God ſtrengthen in vs by the ſelfe ſame preaching of the word and alſo, by the vſe of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. What calleſt thou the Sacraments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Sacraments bee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes ordaind of God, for the greater aſſurance and ſtrengthening of our Faith; beeing vnto vs, ſure pledges of theſe benefits of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which we receiue in

They ſerue alſo for a marke of our profeſſion, whereby we differ from other people which be Heathen.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am taught and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by Baptiſme, that my ſinnes are forgiuen mee: for as the water waſheth away the filthineſſe of my bodie, euen ſo ſhould I through the holy Ghoſt, be thereby fully

            <p>Qu. <hi>What ſtrength of faith do wee finde in the vſe of the Lords Supper?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Supper of the Lord, thorough the holy-Ghoſt,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:131953:32"/> doth ſtrengthen my Faith, that I ſhould not doubt, but as ſurely as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Bread and Wine into my body, to become wholly mine, ſo my ſoule receiueth withall Chriſt, with his paſſion and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to be wholy mine, as ſurely as if I had wrought them mine owne ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>Are not then the bread and wine in the ſupper of the Lord, turned into the body and bloud of Chriſt?</hi>

               <hi>An.</hi> The bread and wine as touching their nature and ſubſtance are not turned: but as touching the vſe of them, they differ from common Bread and Wine, in that they are appointed of God, to ſerue vnto vs as Seales &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>An.</hi> In preparing my ſelfe to receiue the ſupper of the Lord, I ought diligently to obſerue theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to examine my ſelfe whether I ſtand in faith or no, which I ſhall know, if I feele my hart aſſured by the Spirit of God, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of my ſins is fully diſcharged in Chriſt, and that whatſoeuer hee hath done, pertaineth not onely to others, but euen to me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to examine my ſelfe whether I find my hart inwardly ſorry for my ſins, with inward hatred and lothing of ſin, and an earneſt

            <p>Thirdly, if any offence be betwixt others and me, that I reconcile my ſelfe vnto them. All theſe things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ought earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſidered in the whole courſe of our life, yet then eſpecially, when wee come to the ſupper of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>Now ſeeing wee be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by Chriſtes Works, without our deſeruings, wherto then now ſerueth our wel doings, or what auaileth it to do good workes?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> We muſt do good workes, not to deſerue our ſaluation by them, but by our works to glorifie God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:131953:33"/> in walking as becommeth Gods Children, declaring thereby our thankfulnes to God for our redemption.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by our works to make our election more certaine vnto our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to winne others vnto Chriſt, by our holy life and conuerſation.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What works calleſt thou good works.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Que. <hi>Becauſe prayer is one eſpeciall meanes which Gad will haue vs vſe to increaſe our faith, tell me what belongeth to true prayer?</hi>

While I ſtood in the preſence of thy Ordinances, Lord how my minde wandered from thee, while my bodie was before thee. Nay, my diſharted mind peruerted my body alſo, that euen with much deadneſſe of the outward man, much drowſineſſe and irreuerence, I behaued my ſelfe ſo before thee, as I durſt not before my Friend; as I might giue iuſt aduantage to mine Enemie: rather thinking the time too

Oh the infinite riches of the wiſedome of God! How wiſely didſt thou abaſe thy Seruant at home, where hee ſought to aduance himſelfe in priuat by profiting others, who neither ſought thine honour abroad, nor how to benefit himſelfe by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ordinances. And yet how mercifully diddeſt thou heerein deale with him, by calling him to account, and charging him as an vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeruant, for his vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy walking before thee in the publike, while he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

Create in mee (O Lord) a cleane heart, that I may appeare all faire before thee, and renew a right ſpirit within mee, that I may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee in ſpirit and truth: Reſtore to me the ioy of thy ſaluation, that I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of thy loue vnto me, and ſtabliſh me with thy free ſpirit, that I may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly loue thee againe and neuer depart from thy holy couenant: grant me to renew my couenant daily with thee, that thou maieſt be for euer with me, to keepe me in thy feare: and keepe mee daily lowly in mine owne eyes, that ſtill I may bee accepted of thee in thy beloued. Giue mee truſt in

O ſtrengthen mee with the ſtrong cries of thy bleſſed Spirit, that I may be feruent in prayer, to wreſtle with thy Maieſty, that ſo thou maiſt haſten thy worke to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, And though I finde not that comfort I haue had, or deſire: yet let this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me that I haue done thy will, and let it humble mee ſtill, that I am not fit for the comfort I doe deſire, that ſo with patience I may waite for the ſame, comforting my ſelfe, that ſeeing this is the time of my warfare, and

And euen ſo, come Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus come quickly, Amen.</p>
